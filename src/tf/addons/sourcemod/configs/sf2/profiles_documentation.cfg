//		This profiles example may contain outdated, incorrect or missing info. There is a lot of stuff in SF2 Modified, an insane amount of complexity that often requires high maintenance.
// 		This is the most accurate listing of boss config settings in Slender Fortress Modified, spanning as far back as post 0.2.8.
//		This guide is made for creators who want to submit bosses for any Slender Fortress Modified server.

// Slender Fortress - Boss Profiles
//
// Here is where all data about a boss is put, such as their behavior, sanity increase/decrease rates, animations, appear chance, etc.
// Some fields are required to be put in the profile data, but most of them are optional. All values involving time are in seconds unless stated otherwise.
// Not all fields are required to be written in a boss's profile. Optional fields will have a default value.
//
// Any sections ( {} ) abbrieviated with "sound_" will have its contents automatically precached and put in the server downloads table. Some of them also have several keyvalues that
// allows you to change how the sound is played in the game, including _channel, _pitch, _volume, _level, _cooldown_min, and _cooldown_max. Of course, they're all optional, but this 
// mostly only applies to boss type 2 sounds and proxy sounds.
//
// For example:
//
// 	"sound_chasingenemy"
//	{
//		"1"	"cof/slowerno/idle1.wav"
//		"2"	"cof/slowerno/idle2.wav"
//	}
//
//	"sound_chasingenemy_cooldown_min"	"1.5"
//	"sound_chasingenemy_cooldown_max"	"2.1"
//	"sound_chasingenemy_volume"	"0.7" //Do not go over 1.0
//	"sound_chasingenemy_pitch" "100" //Values between 1 and 255 work, no decimals must be used.
//
// Any other mentions of the word "section" involves sections of lines enclosed with braces ( {} ), like the example.
// Sections list their content one by one, each assigned by a number that increases as more content is inserted like the example. The content numbers HAVE to be in sequence,
// or else the gamemode might read a non-existent value and/or not be able to read that value at all. Some sections only support 1 content, which means no matter how much
// content you put into it only the first one will be read and used. They're noted in this guide.
//
// If you are familiar with VS. Saxton Hale/Freak Fortress 2, the mod_precache, mod_download, mat_download, and download sections works the same way. If you're not, there's more information
// about it below.
//
// Put the full path of a model or a material in mod_download or mat_download WITHOUT its extension, and all their associated extensions will be automatically be put into the downloads table.
// Any section that is prefixed with sound_ will automatically be precached and queued for downloading, so there's no need to put the sounds in a download section.
//
// If for any reason a download is missing, the plugin will print out a log file that can be found in addons/sourcemod/logs/sf2/, from there you can see which bosses have broken downloads. Single string downloads count as well.
// Broken downloads will not be downloaded, models will still be precached to avoid server crashing, and sounds will still be precached to avoid not precached sounds in the server.
//
// =============================================

// NOTE: "teleport_target_stress_min" value will steadily increase as the boss's anger increases, in relation to "teleport_target_stress_max"
// "teleport_dist_between_copies" - Determines the distance between copies when teleporting to a target, useful for bosses you want to spawn in groups for a single target or if you want them spread out to focus multiple players at once.

// Careful when making many boss effects, the maximum entity limit on a TF2 game is 2048 and map entities are counted, recommend to do only 8 effects maximum.

// =============================================
// 		ADVANCED ANIMATIONS		
// =============================================
// Advanced Animations is more complex in nature compared to the traditional method of animations.
// Instead of using only one type of animation for their state, bosses are able to use up to 8 different configured animations of their choosing.
// Ontop of this, they are also able to use different animations in these blocks based on the difficulty.
// For this instance, for non-difficulty based advanced animations, we will borrow the Rakes profile.

// Currently some of the public bosses have been updated with the difficulty based animations. It is pretty straight forward to add to the bosses that don't utilize this system.
//
// Add into the same number as your desired animation with the _hard, _insane, _nightmare, & _apollyon prefixes for animations such as "animation_walk".
//
// NOTE: You will need to set "difficulty_affects_animations" to "1" in your boss profile in order to use difficulty based animations.
// NOTE2: This only applies for idle, walk, walk alert, and run animation sets, for everything else, it is completely ignored and no longer needed for all the other animations.
// NOTE3: You can use footstep intervals based on the difficulty for idle, walking, alert walking, and running. Make sure those values are set if you're gonna use difficulty affects animations and footsteps.
// NOTE4: If any of these values have blank values, then it will use the difficulty before what it is, so if its Nightmare and there is no animation for Nightmare, it'll use the Insane animation, goes all the way down to Normal.

//
// This system can only be used if you have your advanced animations set up.

//	--- REPEATING ATTACKS ---
//
// Repeating attacks use the advanced animation system to achieve this. It is very similar to the setup above, but the keyvalues have different affects on the input.
// To use this properly, simply take the attack_delay time and multiply it by however many times you want it, so if you want 4 times, you multiply attack_delay by 4 and put the result in attack_endafter.

// 			BOSS ATTRIBUTES				
// =====================================================
//
// Boss Attributes are specific settings on a boss that change certain aspects about the boss.
// These can range from stat changes to the bosses to impacts to the bosses victims.
//
// An example of attributes in the boss profile look like this.
//
//		"attributes"
//		{
//			"always look at target" // Name of the attribute.
//			{
//				"value"	"1" // Value to set on the attribute. Always seen as float values.
//			}
//
//			"reduced speed on look"
//			{
//				"value"	"0.6"
//			}
//
//			"reduced walk speed on look"
//			{
//				"value"	"0.4"
//			}
//		}
//
// Here is a list of all the current attributes in the gamemode.
// NOTE: An Attribute Value must be set to 0.0 or higher for it to work for the boss.

// =====================================================
// 		CHAT MESSAGE UPON DEATH			
// =====================================================
//
// This is a basic, print to chat function that prints the Clients Name followed by a message from the bosses profile.
// It is fairly straight forward, yet could add some degree of personality or charm to the boss in question.
// NOTE: Chat messages can only be a maximum of 255 characters, so plan accordingly when writing your messages.
//
// This is how it looks in the profiles, this is a sample taken from Slender's profile.
// These messages will always print if the boss is considered as the inflictor upon the clients death.
//
// An example of how this would appear in would would be "[SF2] Player got killed by Slender."
//
// 		"chat_message_upon_death"
//		{
//			"1"	"was caught by Slender."
//			"2"	"angered Slender by taking his pages."
//			"3"	"decided it was a good idea to take on Slender."
//			"4"	"didn't know what they got themselves into."
//		}
//
//
// There is also "chat_message_upon_death_prefix" which allows you to change the prefix of the message.
// By default this uses "[SF2]", but can be changed to another prefix, such as "[SCP]".
//
// However, if this is missing from the profile. It will not attempt to print any messages.
// Ontop of that, if the boss is allowed to attack blue, it will also stop printing these messages to avoid spam.
//
// In addition to all of this, you have 3 special chat key values that you can use inside your death messages that'll do specific things to the chat messages.
// [PLAYER] filters in the player's name in the death message that can be placed anywhere rather than the start.
// [BOSS] filters in the boss' name, including difficulty names.
// [ROUNDTIME] filters in the round's time based on when grace period ended. This is an int value, not a float value.
//
// 		"chat_message_upon_death"
//		{
//			"1"	"[PLAYER] reported [BOSS] to Mentrillum, neither of them found it funny."
//			"2"	"[BOSS] thought it was ok to kill [PLAYER], which it indeed was."
//			"3"	"In [ROUNDTIME] seconds, [PLAYER] died."
//			"4"	"What more do you want [PLAYER], do you want to die more?"
//		}
//
// Finally, to spice up your chat messages, you can use chat colors. These ones can clutter your chat messages, so do be prepared.
// In order to use chat colors, you need to put in lets say {green} before all characters you want to be green for example. In game, all characters after {green} will be the color green.
// You don't even have to just use green, you can use a massive list of colors found in morecolors.inc. Simply find the function stock Handle:InitColorTrie() in the inc file and choose the color you want.
// All chat colors by default use {default}, not {white}. [PLAYER] is the only filter that has a predefined color system, its {red}[PLAYER]{default}.
// Actually determining the color value from morecolors.inc is easy as taking the third value from SetTrieValue and copying everything after 0x, then feeding that value in a color hex viewer.
//
// 		"chat_message_upon_death"
//		{
//			"1"	"[PLAYER], do you like {red}red death messages?{default} We've got you."
//			"2"	"[PLAYER], don't like {red}red death messages?{default} How about {blue}blue death messages{default}?"
//			"3"	"Still not sure [PLAYER]? Well you can use {green}green, {yellow}yellow, {purple}purple, {crimson}crimson, {default}and many more."
//			"4"	"You want to make [BOSS] the Valve color [PLAYER]? Boom, {valve}[BOSS]{default} is now the Valve color."
//          "5" "You want to make [ROUNDTIME] the Genuine color [PLAYER]? Boom, {genuine}[ROUNDTIME]{default} is now the Genuine player.
//		}
//
// In total, there are 174 colors to choose from (Counting {default}), so go crazy if you want. Colors also apply to "chat_message_upon_death_prefix".
